The goal in making this project was to create a puzzle game much like Scribblenauts. In this game, players must draw shapes and lines in order to create a path for a ball to reach the goal. The ball should be able to be pushed by the shapes that players create, with larger shapes having more mass and will therefor be able to launch the ball faster. For instance, creating a shape above the ball and having that shape drop on it will move the ball. I unfortunately was unable to get the colliders for the line renderer working properly, but all of the pieces of the game are here.
